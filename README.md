# movies
Mobile application in React Native to search for movies.

## Functionalities:
The app contains two tabs:
- The "Search" one, where the user can search for movies by their titles. If no search is provided, the list will be created based on popular movies;
- The "Favorites" one, where the user can see the movies he marked as "favorite".

Each movie is represented on the screen by a card, initially containing its poster, name and a star icon which can be used to mark the movie as a favorite. By clicking the card, it is flipped and some additional information, such as overview and rate, is showed.

## Technologies used:
- React Native;
